# TODO List for Full RAG Pipeline Implementation

## Core Requirements ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Data Ingestion: Implement text extraction and chunking from PDF files (sentence-based chunking)
- [x] Data Ingestion: Develop API endpoint to upload PDF files (/upload endpoint)
- [x] Query Processing: Intent detection (greetings, short queries)
- [x] Query Processing: Transform query to improve retrieval (abbreviation expansion, stopword removal)
- [x] Semantic Search: Design search mechanism using processed query (hybrid search)
- [x] Semantic Search: Combine semantic and keyword results (hybrid search with averaging)
- [x] Post-processing: Advanced re-ranking with multiple signals (page position, chunk length, term density)
- [x] Generation: Call LLM with prompt template to generate answers (Mistral API integration)
- [x] UI: Implement a chat UI to interact with the system (HTML/JS interface)

## FastAPI Endpoints ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Ingestion: POST /upload - Upload one or more PDF files
- [x] Querying: POST /query - Query the system with user questions (hybrid search)
- [x] Querying: Enhanced /query with generation, citations, and confidence scores
- [x] Demo: GET /demo - Demo endpoint with sample query
- [x] Root: GET / - Serves chat UI
- [x] Docs: GET /docs - Interactive API documentation (Swagger UI)

## Bonus Features ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Citations: Refuse to answer if top-k chunks don't meet similarity threshold (SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD = 0.3)
- [x] Answer shaping: Context-aware prompt templates with system instructions
- [x] Query refusal policies: 
  - [x] PII detection (SSN, credit card, email, phone)
  - [x] Legal disclaimers (lawsuit, attorney, legal advice keywords)
  - [x] Medical disclaimers (diagnosis, medication, treatment keywords)
- [x] Advanced re-ranking: Multiple signals for improved retrieval

## Deliverables ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] README.md with comprehensive system design, architecture diagrams, and documentation
- [x] Python implementation using FastAPI with all required endpoints
- [x] Links to libraries and technologies used
- [x] UI: Interactive HTML/JS chat interface
- [x] Git commit history showing development progress
- [x] No external search/RAG libraries (custom implementation)
- [x] No third-party vector database (JSONL storage)

## Testing ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Server startup and chunk loading (93 chunks)
- [x] Web UI functionality
- [x] Query endpoint with real data
- [x] CORS configuration
- [x] Hybrid search (keyword + semantic)
- [x] LLM generation with Mistral API
- [x] API documentation (Swagger UI)
- [x] Advanced re-ranking
- [x] Similarity threshold enforcement
- [x] Query refusal policies (PII, legal, medical)
- [x] Intent detection
- [x] Edge cases (greetings, irrelevant queries, short queries)

## Project Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All requirements, bonus features, and deliverables have been successfully implemented and tested.
The system is production-ready for moderate-scale deployments (<10k chunks).

See TEST_RESULTS.md for detailed test results and compliance verification.
